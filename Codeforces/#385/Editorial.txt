I really apologize for the ambiguity of this problem. We worked hard to make it concise and accurate, but we left out too many details.
Basically, the idea is we want to overlay two of these pieces together so that no square has more than 1 X, and the region of X's forms a rectangle.
Now for the solution:
First, let's look at it backwards. I have a rectangle, and I cut it in two pieces. These two pieces have the same exact shape. What shapes can I form?
A necessary and sufficient condition is that the piece itself is a rectangle itself! There are a few ways to check this. 
One is, find the min/max x/y coordinates, and make sure the number of X's match the bounding box of all the points.

First, let's make all connected components cliques. This graph is still stable.
Now, there are some components without special nodes. Where should we connect them?
If there is a component with size A and a component with size B, we can add A*B edges if we connect these two components. So, it makes sense to choose the largest component.
